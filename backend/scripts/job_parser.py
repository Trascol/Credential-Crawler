# This will be used to parse through job listings,

# then when the user wants to apply, we parse through the job listing, gather what field this is in, what skills we would need
# then from this take the users resume/skills and create a brand new resume based around what the job listing would want
# ex/ jr. Web dev

# blah blah blah HTML, CSS, Javascript

# take skills and field and match it to user,
# If user skills match job listing skills then add to users resume
# once done doing a bunch of stuff apply to the job listing
